Keymon - keyboard monitor and statistic system.

This nice piece of code is intended to accumulate statistic of how you, my
friend, are using your keyboard. The big target of this project is to build
heatmap of keyboard buttons. 

Keymon consists of
* Keymon Linux kernel module (src/lkm) that receive keyboard notifications from
  Linux kernel and sends it to daemon
* Keymon daemon is receiving messages from Keymon LKM and saves it frequency in
  storage.

It's education project and IS NOT KEYLOGGER.
